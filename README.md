This is the respository for my web application Select-A-Major. Select a major from the dropdown menu and when you press search markers will appear on the screen to represent all the colleges in Missouri that offer that major. If you click on the marker the name of the college will pop up and the "visit site" link will send you to the website for that particular college. If select the first option (Select-A-Major) the web application will all the colleges currently in the database. Hopefully this helps out your major search!
